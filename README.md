What is batterypy?
--------------------
batterypy is a required helper library for pizzapy program, built by Chris Sze. 

It depends on Python's battery-included Standard Library only, so this library is named batterypy.

batterypy's code can be used in projects other than pizzapy, so I made it a separate library.
